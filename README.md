The Odin Project Recipes Website Project:

Time to put all of the HTML knowledge I have been acquiring so far with the Odin Project's Foundations course into practice. I am going to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty, but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops.

This project will be revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.
